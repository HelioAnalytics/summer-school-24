## Introduction to Machine Learning


### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is generally recognized as a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are many ways that AI and ML are defined and represented, the following figure from

### Why has Machine Learning become so common?

There are major changes to the data science landscape:
- Dramatic increase in the volume and accessibility of data
- Growth in computational capabilities (cloud, GPU, etc.).  Methods that would have been computationally prohibitive in the past are now feasible.
- Major advances in our understanding of how information is derived from data and how it gains context to become “knowledge.”  
- Open source, sharable software environments
- Advanced visualization and data representation

### The growth of machine learning is part of the growth of data science in general.
