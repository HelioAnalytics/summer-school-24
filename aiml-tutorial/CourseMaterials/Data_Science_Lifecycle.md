## The Data Science Lifecycle

Practitioners of data science have studied best practices to maximize the probability of success. Most agree that "business understanding" or "subject matter expertise" is one of the key steps. And, of course, there is data wrangling, which can be expressed in a variety of ways.

Next comes the process of determining which models to try, and which features work best. This is an iterative process, the simple "circle" is misleading. In reality, there are many iterations, thus there are process models such as the *Cross-industry standard process for data mining*, or **CRISP-DM** that express the need to examine and refine your effort at every stage of the lifecycle.

A team at NASA GSFC studied several ML efforts for science research, and found that even more iterations are typical. For example, dedicating a lot of effort to "data cleaning" is important, but you may not know whether the dataset is sufficient or appropriate until you examine the data more closely and monitor the machine learning model's performance. The following figure documents one specific effort:

The JPL Council for *Scientific Understanding from Data
Science*, or *SUDS*, expressed in their Phase 1 Council Report (*Owens et al.*, 2021) how data science and machine learning fit within the landscape of "traditional" science. They found that the traditional "Confirmatory Statistics" approach (e.g. formulate hypothesis, test hypothesis) is augmented by the Data-Driven Approach. This important stage is characterized by Exploratory Statistics and data-driven discovery.  More simply put, it's where you get to know your data, and allow the data to speak for itself. **This may be the most important part of the data science lifecycle, as it creates a pathway to truly new discoveries.**
