    "The data displayed in the top panel doesn't come from MMS -- it shows two approximations of the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index.  Production of the definitive AE index from a standard set of ground magnetometer stations can lag by months or years, so it's not useful for near real-time analysis.  Instead, we use a so-called \"Kyoto proxy AE\" index, derivied from some near-real-time plots available from the Kyoto World Data Center, and a \"THEMIS AE index\" derived from a set of ground magnetometers operated in conjunction with the THEMIS satellite mission.  Higher values of the AE index indicate more geomagnetic activity.\n",

    "Panel 2 shows the MMS-1 magnetic field measurements.   The peak indicates when MMS-1 was near perihelion. (This is more useful when zooming into shorter time intervals, or reducing the Y range so the strong fields near perigee don't dominate the plot.)\n",

    "From 01:00 to 02:00, MMS-1 was in the solar wind.  At 02:00 it encounters the bow shock and enters the magnetosheath.  Around 03:00 we can see the solar wind proton density start to increase, with the flow speed remaining steady at about 440 km/sec, which increases the dynamic pressure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the \"MMS, THEMIS, Arase orbits\" notebook, higher dynamic pressure causes the magnetopause to move inward -- in this case, pushing it inward enough so that MMS-1 finds itself back in the solar wind between 03:15 and 04:20.  The solar wind density and pressure start decreasing around 3:45, and around 04:30 MMS-1 encounters the bow shock for a second time.  A small increasse in the pressure is visible at around 04:15, and MMS-1 is briefly back in the solar wind around 04:40 - 04:50, when it crosses the bow shock for a third time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 04:40 - 07:10, MMS-1 is in the magnetosheath.  Near the end of this period, the magnetic field changes direction, and fast ion flows are encountered and also change direction -- this is the signature of a magnetic reconnection event.\n",
    "\n",
    "From about 7:10 on, MMS-1 is fully within the magnetosphere. Bz has turned from negative in the solar wind, to positive in Earth's magnetic field, and the particle density is lower than previously seen in the solar wind and magnetosheath."
